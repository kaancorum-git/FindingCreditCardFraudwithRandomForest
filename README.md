My Graduation Project also TÜBİTAK(scientific and technological research council of turkey)'s project. Good example of using RandomForestClassifier and a option for RandomForostRegressior. Using SMOTE method for solving the unbalanced data issue. İncludes matpplotlib library for visiulation the results. Couldn't include neither the data or any of it's feature names. All of the feature names changed into f1,f2,..fn.
