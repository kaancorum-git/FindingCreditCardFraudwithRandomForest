# My graduation Project.Also TÜBİTAK(scientific and technological research council of turkey)'s project. Main goal is finding the fraud datas using Machine Learning and Data Mining. Couldn't upload or show many of the data reports due to the data is being very valueable. Good example of using RandomForestClassifier and option of using RandomForestRegressor. Includes SMOTE method of using as a solver for unbalanced data.
