My Graduation Project. Good example of using RandomForestClassifier and a option for RandomForostRegressior. Using SMOTE method for solving the unbalanced data issue. Ä°ncludes matplotlib library for visiulation the results. Couldn't include neither the data or any of it's feature names. All of the feature names changed into f1,f2,..fn.
