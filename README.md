My Graduation Project is about finding Credit Card Frauds with using data mining and machine learning. This file only consists of the code not the information about data.  Good example of using RandomForestClassifier and a option for RandomForostRegressior. Using SMOTE method for solving the unbalanced data issue. Includes matplotlib library for visiulation of the results. Couldn't include neither the data or any of it's feature names. All of the feature names changed into f1,f2,..fn.
